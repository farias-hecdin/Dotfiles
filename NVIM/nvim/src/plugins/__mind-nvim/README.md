This plugin is a new take on note taking and task workflows. The idea is derived from using several famous plugins, such
as [org-mode] or even standalone applications, like [Notion], and add new and interesting ideas.

# Motivation

**Mind** is an organizer tool for Neovim. It can be used to accomplish and implement a wide variety of workflows. It is
designed to quickly add items in trees. _Why a tree?_ Well, list of things like TODO lists are great but they lack the
organization part. Most of them can be gathered in “lists of lists” — you probably have that on your phone. A list of
list is basically a tree. But editing and operating a list of list is annoying, so it’s better to have a tool that has
the concept of a node and a tree as a primitive.

**Mind** trees can be used to implement workflows like:

- Journaling. Have a node for each day, which parent will be the month, which parent will be the year, etc.
- Note taking. You are in the middle of a meeting and you heard something important? Don’t write that in a Markdown
  document in your `~/documents` that is probably alreaddy a mess: open your **Mind** tree and add it there!
- “Personal wiki.” Because of the nature of a tree, it is convenient to organize your personal notes about your work
  services, other teams’ products, OKRs, blablabla by simply creating trees in trees!
- Task management. Why not having a tasks tree with three or four sub-trees for your backlog, on-going work, finished
  work and cancelled tasks? It’s all possible!

The possibilities are endless.

# Features

**Mind** features two main concepts; global trees and local trees:

- A global tree is a tree that is unique to your machine / computer. Opening your main **Mind** tree from Neovim will
  always open and edit that tree. It’s basically your central place for your **Mind** nodes.
- A local tree is a tree that is relative to a given directory. **Mind** implements a `cwd`-based local form of tree, so
  you can even share those trees with other people (as long as they use **Mind** as well).

Atop of that, **Mind** has the concept of “project” trees, which are either a global tree, or a local tree. A global
project tree is stored at the same place as your main tree and the purpose of such a tree is to be opened only when your
`cwd` is the same as the tree, but you don’t want the tree to be in the actual `cwd`. That can be the case if you work
on a project where you don’t want to check the tree in Git or any versioning system.

On the other side, a local project tree is what it means: it lives in the `cwd`, under `.mind`, basically.

Besides that, **Mind** allows you to manipulate trees and nodes. Feature set:

- Everything is interactive and relies on the most recent features of Neovim, including `vim.ui.input` and
  `vim.ui.select`. Very few dependencies on other plugins, so you can customize the UI by using the plugins you love.
- Cursor-base interaction. Open a tree and start interacting with it!
  - Expand / collapse nodes.
  - Add a node to a tree by adding it before or after the current node, or by adding it inside the current node at the
    beginning or end of its chilren.
  - Rename the node under the cursor.
  - Change the icon of the node under the cursor.
  - Delete the node under the cursor with a confirmation input.
  - Select a node to perform further operations on it.
  - Move nodes around!
  - Select nodes by path! — e.g. `/Tasks/On-going/3345: do this`
- Supports user keybindings via keymaps. Keymaps are namespaced keybindings. They keymaps are fixed and defined by
  **Mind**, and users can decide what to put in them. For instance, you have the _default_ keymap for default
  navigation, _selection_ keymap for when a node is selected, etc. etc.
- Nodes are just text, icons and some metadata by default. You can however decide to associate them with a _data file_,
  for which the type is user-defined (by default Markdown), or you can turn them into URL nodes.
- A data node will open its file when triggered.
- A URL node will open its link when triggered.
- A well documented Lua API to create your own automatic workflow that don’t require user interaction!
- More to come!

# Getting started

This section will guide you through the list of steps you must take to be able to get started with **Mind**.


## Prerequisites

This plugin was written against Neovim 0.7.2, so you need to ensure you are running **Neovim 0.7.2 or higher**.

Lua dependencies:

- [plenary.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/plenary.nvim), which can be required with `'nvim-lua/plenary.nvim'`.

## Installation

This installation guide uses [packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim) but the procedure should be quite
similar for other package managers.

```lua
use {
  'phaazon/mind.nvim',
  branch = 'v2.2',
  requires = { 'nvim-lua/plenary.nvim' },
  config = function()
    require'mind'.setup()
  end
}
```

This will bring you a default experience. Feel free to customize later the `setup` invocation (`:h mind.setup`).

### Important note about versioning

This plugin implements [SemVer] via git branches and tags. Versions are prefixed with a `v`, and only patch versions
are git tags. Major and minor versions are git branches. You are **very strongly advised** to use a major version
dependency to be sure your config will not break when Mind gets updated.

- Major versions always have the form `vM`, where `M` is the major version. — e.g. `v2`.
- Minor versions always have the form `vM.N`, where `M` is the major version and `N` the minor. — e.g. `v2.0`.
- Patch versions always have the form `vM.N.P`, where `M` is the major version, `N` the minor and `P` the patch. — e.g.
  `v2.0.0`.

**It is strongly discouraged to use `master` as that branch can introduce breaking changes at any time.**

### Nightly users

Mind supports nightly releases of Neovim. However, keep in mind that if you are on a nightly version, you must be **on
the last one**. If you are not, then you are exposed to Neovim compatibility issues / breakage.

# Usage

A wiki is planned, but for now, you can simply have a look at `:h mind-usage` and `:h mind-commands`.

# Keybindings

The user commands defined by Mind are mapped to no keybindings by default. However, once you have a tree open,
buffer-local keybindings are automatically inserted. You can change them by setting they behavior you want in
`opts.keymaps`. More information about that in `:h mind-config-keymaps`.
