## :warning: Important updates

To reduce the size of the repository, I have made some changes that could produce errors when updating the plugin if it was installed before these changes. One way to fix this is to reinstall the plugin completely (that is, remove and install).

## The never-ending problem

I want to manage Neovim buffers easily, without the mental overhead of remembering its ids or partial names. Buffer management includes moving to a buffer and deleting/adding one or more buffers.

## The proposed solution

Use a buffer-like floating window where all the open buffers are listed. To select one buffer, just hit its line number, or move to it and press `<CR>`. To delete the buffer, delete it from the list. To add it (predictably) add a filename to the list.


## Installation

* Neovim 0.5.0+ required
* Install `buffer_manager` using your favorite plugin manager. E.g. `Packer.nvim`:

```lua
use 'nvim-lua/plenary.nvim'  -- basic dependency
use 'j-morano/buffer_manager.nvim'
```

## Usage

### View all buffers and go to a buffer

```lua
:lua require("buffer_manager.ui").toggle_quick_menu()
```

Then, move to one of them, and open it with `<CR>`.
Alternative: press the key corresponding to its line number (notice that, in this case, 0 maps to 10, since there is no 0 line).

### Add buffer/Create file

Write the filename of the new buffer.

(Some people will find this useless, but I often use this functionality together with an autocomplete for files.)

Tip: you can use the Neovim built-in file autocomplete functionality (`<C-x><C-f>`) to ease the opening of new files.

If the file does not exist, a new empty buffer will be created, which will be written to the specified file when it is saved.

### Remove buffer

Delete it in the buffer menu.

**Note:** the plugin does not remove terminal buffers or modified buffers.

### Reorganize buffers

The buffers can be reorganized in any way. To do it, just move the name of the buffer to the chosen line.

### Go to next or previous buffer in the list

```lua
:lua require("buffer_manager.ui").nav_next()
:lua require("buffer_manager.ui").nav_prev()
```

## Configuration

### Plugin configuration

The plugin can be configured through the setup function:
```lua
require("buffer_manager").setup({ })
```

#### Available configuration options
* `select_menu_item_commands`: Lua table containing the keys and the corresponding `command` to run for the buffer under the cursor.
* `line_keys`: keys bound to each line of the buffer menu, in order.
* `focus_alternate_buffer`: place the cursor over the alternate buffer instead of the current buffer.
* `width`: Width in columns (if > 1) or relative to window width (if <= 1).
* `height`: Height in rows (if > 1) or relative to window height (if <= 1).

#### Default configuration
```lua
  {
    line_keys = "1234567890",
    select_menu_item_commands = {
      edit = {
        key = "<CR>",
        command = "edit"
      }
    },
    focus_alternate_buffer = false,
  }
```

#### Example configuration
```lua
require("buffer_manager").setup({
  line_keys = "",  -- deactivate line keybindings
  select_menu_item_commands = {
    v = {
      key = "<C-v>",
      command = "vsplit"
    },
    h = {
      key = "<C-h>",
      command = "split"
    }
  },
  width = 0.8
})
```


### Example keybinding for opening the buffer menu

To open the buffer menu, you can put this line in your Lua configuration file.
```lua
vim.keymap.set({ 't', 'n' }, '<M-Space>', require("buffer_manager.ui").toggle_quick_menu, {noremap = true})
```

### Other useful settings

#### Reorder buffers

Since the buffer menu is just a buffer with the specific file type `buffer_manager`, you can define your own remaps using an autocmd for this filetype. For example, the following remaps allow to move a line up and down in visual mode with capital K and J, respectively.
```vim
autocmd FileType buffer_manager vnoremap J :m '>+1<CR>gv=gv
autocmd FileType buffer_manager vnoremap K :m '<-2<CR>gv=gv
```
This is very useful for reorganizing the buffers.

You can also set the previous autocmds with Lua as follows:
```lua
vim.api.nvim_command([[
autocmd FileType buffer_manager vnoremap J :m '>+1<CR>gv=gv
autocmd FileType buffer_manager vnoremap K :m '<-2<CR>gv=gv
]])
```

#### Navigate buffers without opening the menu

You can define custom keybindings for navigating buffers without opening the menu, but respecting the order in which the buffers appear in it.

```lua
local keys = '1234567890'
for i = 1, #keys do
  local key = keys:sub(i,i)
  map(
    'n',
    string.format('<leader>%s', key),
    function () require("buffer_manager.ui").nav_file(i) end,
    opts
  )
end
```

## Logging

- Logs are written to `buffer_manager.log` within the nvim cache path (`:echo stdpath("cache")`)
- Available log levels are `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, or `fatal`. `warn` is default
- Log level can be set with `vim.g.buffer_manager_log_level` (must be **before** `setup()`)
- Launching nvim with `BUFFER_MANAGER_LOG=debug nvim` takes precedence over `vim.g.buffer_manager_log_level`.
- Invalid values default back to `warn`.

<!--## Others

### Use a dynamic width for the `buffer_manager` pop-up menu

Sometimes the default width of (`60`) is not enough.
The following example demonstrates how to configure a custom width by setting
the menu's width relative to the current window's width.

```lua
require("buffer_manager").setup({
    width = vim.api.nvim_win_get_width(0) - 4,
})
```

## TODO

* Disable/enable automatic save.
